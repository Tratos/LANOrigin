# LANOrigin
 A OpenSource Games Sales platform 

### About:
While translating for CrazyZhang666's EA app emulator, I realized what a great alternative he's actually designed. Since everyone knows about Origin, Steam, and Epic stores, I considered designing it as a standalone games sales platform, so I could distribute old freeware games over the network at a LAN party, just like on those platforms. I've built in some basic functionality. But I hope someone with more experience with ModernWPF can help me raise the design to CrazyZhang's level, since his client can already do a lot more.
