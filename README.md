# LANOrigin
 A OpenSource Games Sales platform 

### About:
While translating for CrazyZhang666's EA app emulator, 

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage"

I realized what a great alternative he's actually designed. Since everyone knows about Origin, Steam, and Epic stores, I considered designing it as a standalone games sales platform, so I could distribute old freeware games over the network at a LAN party, just like on those platforms. I've built in some basic functionality. But I hope someone with more experience with ModernWPF can help me raise the design to CrazyZhang's level, since his client can already do a lot more.


### Why 
In a free environment, alternative chats can be implemented that not only load games from the server but also exchange them client-to-client. Games like Blobby Volley and TrackMania Nations Forever can be created once and then simply distributed to new players without having to attend the installation process for each player.

## todo
I hope that someone can help me with the design, especially to make it a bit more similar to the original Origin, so that users can find their way around more easily.
